# Weather Dashboard

Created a dashboard for users to search for weather conditions in a given city.  

# Criteria Met

- When a city is searched the user is presented with the current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
- When the user views the current conditions then they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
- When the user views the UV index they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
- The user is presented with a 5-day forecast for the selected city with the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature and the humidity.
-When the user clicks on a city in the history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that selection.
-Upon page refresh, the user is presented with the last searched cities forecast.
